# HGS-DSSAT 1.0 under development
February 04, 2025
This is the repository for HGS-DSSAT. The codes are developed based on the developments made by Dr. Arkadiusz Glogowski (UNIBAS, Switzerland) and Dr. Qi Tang (UNIBAS & UNINE, Switzerland), who previously developed HGS-PDAF. HGS-DSSAT is currently being developed and maintained by Dr. Arkadiusz Glogowski, Paul Southard and Dr. Qi Tang.
## Introduction
HGS-DSSAT is a coupling framework for integrated hydrological modelling and cropping system modelling. It allows updating spatially and temporally distributed hydrological states from integrated surface-subsurface hydrological and transport simulations with water balance and nitrogen cycling simulations using a cropping system model.
