# HGS-DSSAT 1.0 under development
July 10th 2025, 
This is the private repository for HGS-DSSAT. The codes are developed based on the developments made by Dr. Arkadiusz Glogowski and Paul Southard.
## Introduction
HGS-DSSAT is a coupling framework for integrated hydrological modelling and cropping system modelling. It allows updating spatially and temporally distributed hydrological states from integrated surface-subsurface hydrological and transport simulations with water balance and nitrogen cycling simulations using a cropping system model.
